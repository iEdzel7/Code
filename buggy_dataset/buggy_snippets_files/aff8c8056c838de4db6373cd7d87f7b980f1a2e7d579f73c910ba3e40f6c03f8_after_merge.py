        """Predict class for X.

        The predicted class of an input sample is computed as the class with
        the highest mean predicted probability. If base estimators do not
        implement a ``predict_proba`` method, then it resorts to voting.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape = [n_samples, n_features]
            The training input samples. Sparse matrices are accepted only if
            they are supported by the base estimator.

        Returns
        -------
        y : array of shape = [n_samples]
            The predicted classes.
