        Parameters
        ----------
        interrupt: bool
            Interrupt the kernel while running or in Pdb to perform
            the call.
        blocking: bool
            Make a blocking call, i.e. wait on this side until the
            kernel sends its response.
        callback: callable
            Callable to process the response sent from the kernel
            on the Spyder side.
        timeout: int or None
            Maximum time (in seconds) before giving up when making a
            blocking call to the kernel. If None, a default timeout
            (defined in commbase.py, present in spyder-kernels) is
            used.
