        Do something as this account. This method is never called normally,

        command. It takes account nicks into account, but not nicks of
        eventual puppets.

        Args:
            raw_string (str): Raw command input coming from the command line.
            session (Session, optional): The session to be responsible
                for the command-send

        Keyword Args:
            kwargs (any): Other keyword arguments will be added to the
                found command object instance as variables before it
                executes. This is unused by default Evennia but may be
                used to set flags and change operating paramaters for
                commands at run-time.
