    """Project the sample on the first eigen vectors of the graph Laplacian.

    The adjacency matrix is used to compute a normalized graph Laplacian
    whose spectrum (especially the eigen vectors associated to the
    smallest eigen values) has an interpretation in terms of minimal
    number of cuts necessary to split the graph into comparably sized
    components.

    This embedding can also 'work' even if the ``adjacency`` variable is
    not strictly the adjacency matrix of a graph but more generally
    an affinity or similarity matrix between samples (for instance the
    heat kernel of a euclidean distance matrix or a k-NN matrix).

    However care must taken to always make the affinity matrix symmetric
    so that the eigen vector decomposition works as expected.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adjacency : array-like or sparse matrix, shape: (n_samples, n_samples)
        The adjacency matrix of the graph to embed.

    n_components : integer, optional
        The dimension of the projection subspace.

    eigen_solver : {None, 'arpack', 'lobpcg', or 'amg'}
        The eigenvalue decomposition strategy to use. AMG requires pyamg
        to be installed. It can be faster on very large, sparse problems,
        but may also lead to instabilities.

    random_state : int seed, RandomState instance, or None (default)
        A pseudo random number generator used for the initialization of the
        lobpcg eigen vectors decomposition when eigen_solver == 'amg'.
        By default, arpack is used.

    eigen_tol : float, optional, default=0.0
        Stopping criterion for eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix
        when using arpack eigen_solver.

    drop_first : bool, optional, default=True
        Whether to drop the first eigenvector. For spectral embedding, this
        should be True as the first eigenvector should be constant vector for
        connected graph, but for spectral clustering, this should be kept as
        False to retain the first eigenvector.

    Returns
    -------
    embedding : array, shape=(n_samples, n_components)
        The reduced samples.

    Notes
    -----
    Spectral embedding is most useful when the graph has one connected
    component. If there graph has many components, the first few eigenvectors
    will simply uncover the connected components of the graph.
