def _solve_undetermined_coefficients(eq, func, order, match):

    Helper function for the method of undetermined coefficients.

    See the
    :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.ode_nth_linear_constant_coeff_undetermined_coefficients`
    docstring for more information on this method.

    The parameter ``match`` should be a dictionary that has the following
    keys:

    ``list``
      A list of solutions to the homogeneous equation, such as the list
      returned by
      ``ode_nth_linear_constant_coeff_homogeneous(returns='list')``.

    ``sol``
      The general solution, such as the solution returned by
      ``ode_nth_linear_constant_coeff_homogeneous(returns='sol')``.

    ``trialset``
      The set of trial functions as returned by
      ``_undetermined_coefficients_match()['trialset']``.
