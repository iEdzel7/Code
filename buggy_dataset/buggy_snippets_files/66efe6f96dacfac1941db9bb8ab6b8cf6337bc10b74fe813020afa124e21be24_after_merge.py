        Reads stats/logging strings accumulated by the writeStatsAndLogging() method. For each
        stats/logging string this method calls the given callback function with an open,
        readable file handle from which the stats string can be read. Returns the number of
        stats/logging strings processed. Each stats/logging string is only processed once unless
        the readAll parameter is set, in which case the given callback will be invoked for all
        existing stats/logging strings, including the ones from a previous invocation of this
        method.
