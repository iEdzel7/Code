        Most of the seemingly convoluted logic in this completer is an
        attempt to handle filenames with spaces in them.  And yet it's not
        quite perfect, because Python's readline doesn't expose all of the
        GNU readline details needed for this to be done correctly.

        For a filename with a space in it, the printed completions will be
        only the parts after what's already been typed (instead of the
        full completions, as is normally done).  I don't think with the
        current (as of Python 2.3) Python readline it's possible to do
        better."""
