def euclidean_distances(X, Y=None, Y_norm_squared=None, squared=False):
    """
    Considering the rows of X (and Y=X) as vectors, compute the
    distance matrix between each pair of vectors.

    For efficiency reasons, the euclidean distance between a pair of row
    vector x and y is computed as::

        dist(x, y) = sqrt(dot(x, x) - 2 * dot(x, y) + dot(y, y))

    This formulation has two advantages over other ways of computing distances.
    First, it is computationally efficient when dealing with sparse data.
    Second, if x varies but y remains unchanged, then the right-most dot
    product `dot(y, y)` can be pre-computed.

    However, this is not the most precise way of doing this computation, and
    the distance matrix returned by this function may not be exactly
    symmetric as required by, e.g., ``scipy.spatial.distance`` functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape (n_samples_1, n_features)

    Y : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape (n_samples_2, n_features)

    Y_norm_squared : array-like, shape (n_samples_2, ), optional
        Pre-computed dot-products of vectors in Y (e.g.,
        ``(Y**2).sum(axis=1)``)

    squared : boolean, optional
        Return squared Euclidean distances.

    Returns
    -------
    distances : {array, sparse matrix}, shape (n_samples_1, n_samples_2)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import euclidean_distances
    >>> X = [[0, 1], [1, 1]]
    >>> # distance between rows of X
    >>> euclidean_distances(X, X)
    array([[ 0.,  1.],
           [ 1.,  0.]])
    >>> # get distance to origin
    >>> euclidean_distances(X, [[0, 0]])
    array([[ 1.        ],
           [ 1.41421356]])
