        Add a link header to the response.

        See also: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988

        Note:
            Calling this method repeatedly will cause each link to be
            appended to the Link header value, separated by commas.

        Note:
            So-called "link-extension" elements, as defined by RFC 5988,
            are not yet supported. See also Issue #288.

        Args:
            target (str): Target IRI for the resource identified by the
                link. Will be converted to a URI, if necessary, per
                RFC 3987, Section 3.1.
            rel (str): Relation type of the link, such as "next" or
                "bookmark". See also http://goo.gl/618GHr for a list
                of registered link relation types.

        Kwargs:
            title (str): Human-readable label for the destination of
                the link (default ``None``). If the title includes non-ASCII
                characters, you will need to use `title_star` instead, or
                provide both a US-ASCII version using `title` and a
                Unicode version using `title_star`.
            title_star (tuple of str): Localized title describing the
                destination of the link (default ``None``). The value must be a
                two-member tuple in the form of (*language-tag*, *text*),
                where *language-tag* is a standard language identifier as
                defined in RFC 5646, Section 2.1, and *text* is a Unicode
                string.

                Note:
                    *language-tag* may be an empty string, in which case the
                    client will assume the language from the general context
                    of the current request.

                Note:
                    *text* will always be encoded as UTF-8. If the string
                    contains non-ASCII characters, it should be passed as
                    a ``unicode`` type string (requires the 'u' prefix in
                    Python 2).

            anchor (str): Override the context IRI with a different URI
                (default None). By default, the context IRI for the link is
                simply the IRI of the requested resource. The value
                provided may be a relative URI.
            hreflang (str or iterable): Either a single *language-tag*, or
                a ``list`` or ``tuple`` of such tags to provide a hint to the
                client as to the language of the result of following the link.
                A list of tags may be given in order to indicate to the
                client that the target resource is available in multiple
                languages.
            type_hint(str): Provides a hint as to the media type of the
                result of dereferencing the link (default ``None``). As noted
                in RFC 5988, this is only a hint and does not override the
                Content-Type header returned when the link is followed.
