        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)
            Training data, where n_samples is the number of samples
            and n_features is the number of features.

        y : array-like, shape (n_samples,)
            The target variable for supervised learning problems.

        groups : array-like, with shape (n_samples,), optional
            Group labels for the samples used while splitting the dataset into
            train/test set.

        Returns
        -------
        train : ndarray
            The training set indices for that split.

        test : ndarray
            The testing set indices for that split.
