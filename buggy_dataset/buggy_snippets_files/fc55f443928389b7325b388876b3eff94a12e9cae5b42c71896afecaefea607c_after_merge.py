         a list of ratios can be given for which factory in which order should get what ratios as in ``[0.8, 0.1]``.
         The final ratio can be omitted because that can be calculated. Third, all ratios can be explicitly set in
         order such as in ``[0.8, 0.1, 0.1]`` where the sum of all ratios is 1.0.

        :param randomize_cleanup: If true, uses the non-deterministic method for moving triples to the training set.
