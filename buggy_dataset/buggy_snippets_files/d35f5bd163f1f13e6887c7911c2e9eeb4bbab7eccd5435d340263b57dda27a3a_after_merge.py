    def __init__(self, loaders, ctx, name):
        """Dictionary like object that lazily loads its values from an initial
        dict of key-loader function pairs.  Each key is loaded when its value
        is first accessed. Once fully loaded, this object will replace itself
        in the provided context (typically the globals of the call site) with
        the given name.

        For example, you can prevent the compilation of a bunch of regular
        expressions until they are actually used::

            RES = LazyDict({
                    'dot': lambda: re.compile('.'),
                    'all': lambda: re.compile('.*'),
                    'two': lambda: re.compile('..'),
                    }, globals(), 'RES')

        Parameters
        ----------
        loaders : Mapping of keys to functions with no arguments
            A mapping of loader function that performs the actual value
            construction upon acces.
        ctx : Mapping
            Context to replace the LazyDict instance in
            with the the fully loaded mapping.
        name : str
            Name in the context to give the loaded mapping. This *should*
            be the name on the LHS of the assignment.
