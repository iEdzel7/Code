        Generate diff between candidate and running configuration. If the
        remote host supports onbox diff capabilities ie. supports_onbox_diff in that case
        candidate and running configurations are not required to be passed as argument.
        In case if onbox diff capability is not supported candidate argument is mandatory
        and running argument is optional.
        :param candidate: The configuration which is expected to be present on remote host.
        :param running: The base configuration which is used to generate diff.
        :param diff_match: Instructs how to match the candidate configuration with current device configuration
                      Valid values are 'line', 'strict', 'exact', 'none'.
                      'line' - commands are matched line by line
                      'strict' - command lines are matched with respect to position
                      'exact' - command lines must be an equal match
                      'none' - will not compare the candidate configuration with the running configuration
        :param diff_ignore_lines: Use this argument to specify one or more lines that should be
                                  ignored during the diff.  This is used for lines in the configuration
                                  that are automatically updated by the system.  This argument takes
                                  a list of regular expressions or exact line matches.
        :param path: The ordered set of parents that uniquely identify the section or hierarchy
                     the commands should be checked against.  If the parents argument
                     is omitted, the commands are checked against the set of top
                    level or global commands.
        :param diff_replace: Instructs on the way to perform the configuration on the device.
                        If the replace argument is set to I(line) then the modified lines are
                        pushed to the device in configuration mode.  If the replace argument is
                        set to I(block) then the entire command block is pushed to the device in
                        configuration mode if any line is not correct.
        :return: Configuration diff in  json format.
