        load : function with no arguments
            A loader function that performs the actual boolean evaluation.
        ctx : Mapping
            Context to replace the LazyAndSelfDestructiveDict instance in
            with the the fully loaded mapping.
        name : str
            Name in the context to give the loaded mapping. This *should*
            be the name on the LHS of the assignment.
