        """Copy an object or group.

        The source can be a path, Group, Dataset, or Datatype object.  The
        destination can be either a path or a Group object.  The source and
        destinations need not be in the same file.

        If the source is a Group object, all objects contained in that group
        will be copied recursively.

        When the destination is a Group object, by default the target will
        be created in that group with its current name (basename of obj.name).
        You can override that by setting "name" to a string.

        There are various options which all default to "False":

         - shallow: copy only immediate members of a group.

         - expand_soft: expand soft links into new objects.

         - expand_external: expand external links into new objects.

         - expand_refs: copy objects that are pointed to by references.

         - without_attrs: copy object without copying attributes.

       Example:

        >>> f = File('myfile.hdf5')
        >>> f.listnames()
        ['MyGroup']
        >>> f.copy('MyGroup', 'MyCopy')
        >>> f.listnames()
        ['MyGroup', 'MyCopy']
