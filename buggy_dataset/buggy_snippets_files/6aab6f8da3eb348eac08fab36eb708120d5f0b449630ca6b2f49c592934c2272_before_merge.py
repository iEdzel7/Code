def chi2(X, y):
    """Compute chi-squared statistic for each class/feature combination.

    This score can be used to select the n_features features with the
    highest values for the test chi-squared statistic from X, which must
    contain booleans or frequencies (e.g., term counts in document
    classification), relative to the classes.

    Recall that the chi-square test measures dependence between stochastic
    variables, so using this function "weeds out" the features that are the
    most likely to be independent of class and therefore irrelevant for
    classification.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape = (n_samples, n_features_in)
        Sample vectors.

    y : array-like, shape = (n_samples,)
        Target vector (class labels).

    Returns
    -------
    chi2 : array, shape = (n_features,)
        chi2 statistics of each feature.
    pval : array, shape = (n_features,)
        p-values of each feature.

    Notes
    -----
    Complexity of this algorithm is O(n_classes * n_features).
