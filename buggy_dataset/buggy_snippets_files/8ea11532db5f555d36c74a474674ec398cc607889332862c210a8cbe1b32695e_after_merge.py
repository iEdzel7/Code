    """Attempt to produce a deterministic class ID for a given class.

    The goal here is for the class ID to be the same when this is run on
    different worker processes. Pickling, loading, and pickling again seems to
    produce more consistent results than simply pickling. This is a bit crazy
    and could cause problems, in which case we should revert it and figure out
    something better.

    Args:
        cls: The class to produce an ID for.
        depth: The number of times to repeatedly try to load and dump the
            string while trying to reach a fixed point.

    Returns:
        A class ID for this class. We attempt to make the class ID the same
            when this function is run on different workers, but that is not
            guaranteed.

    Raises:
        Exception: This could raise an exception if cloudpickle raises an
            exception.
