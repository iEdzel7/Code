def latinify(string, default="?", pure_ascii=False):
    """
    Convert a unicode string to "safe" ascii/latin-1 characters.
    This is used as a last resort when normal encoding does not work.

    Arguments:
        string (str): A string to convert to 'safe characters' convertable
            to an latin-1 bytestring later.
        default (str, optional): Characters resisting mapping will be replaced
            with this character or string. The intent is to apply an encode operation
            on the string soon after.

    Returns:
        string (str): A 'latinified' string where each unicode character has been
            replaced with a 'safe' equivalent available in the ascii/latin-1 charset.
