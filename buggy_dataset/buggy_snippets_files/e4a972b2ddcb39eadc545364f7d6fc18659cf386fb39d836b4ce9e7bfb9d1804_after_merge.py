    """Concatenate xarray objects along a new or existing dimension.

    Parameters
    ----------
    objs : sequence of Dataset and DataArray objects
        xarray objects to concatenate together. Each object is expected to
        consist of variables and coordinates with matching shapes except for
        along the concatenated dimension.
    dim : str or DataArray or pandas.Index
        Name of the dimension to concatenate along. This can either be a new
        dimension name, in which case it is added along axis=0, or an existing
        dimension name, in which case the location of the dimension is
        unchanged. If dimension is provided as a DataArray or Index, its name
        is used as the dimension to concatenate along and the values are added
        as a coordinate.
    data_vars : {'minimal', 'different', 'all' or list of str}, optional
        These data variables will be concatenated together:
          * 'minimal': Only data variables in which the dimension already
            appears are included.
          * 'different': Data variables which are not equal (ignoring
            attributes) across all datasets are also concatenated (as well as
            all for which dimension already appears). Beware: this option may
            load the data payload of data variables into memory if they are not
            already loaded.
          * 'all': All data variables will be concatenated.
          * list of str: The listed data variables will be concatenated, in
            addition to the 'minimal' data variables.

        If objects are DataArrays, data_vars must be 'all'.
    coords : {'minimal', 'different', 'all' or list of str}, optional
        These coordinate variables will be concatenated together:
          * 'minimal': Only coordinates in which the dimension already appears
            are included.
          * 'different': Coordinates which are not equal (ignoring attributes)
            across all datasets are also concatenated (as well as all for which
            dimension already appears). Beware: this option may load the data
            payload of coordinate variables into memory if they are not already
            loaded.
          * 'all': All coordinate variables will be concatenated, except
            those corresponding to other dimensions.
          * list of str: The listed coordinate variables will be concatenated,
            in addition to the 'minimal' coordinates.
    compat : {'identical', 'equals', 'broadcast_equals', 'no_conflicts', 'override'}, optional
        String indicating how to compare non-concatenated variables of the same name for
        potential conflicts. This is passed down to merge.

        - 'broadcast_equals': all values must be equal when variables are
          broadcast against each other to ensure common dimensions.
        - 'equals': all values and dimensions must be the same.
        - 'identical': all values, dimensions and attributes must be the
          same.
        - 'no_conflicts': only values which are not null in both datasets
          must be equal. The returned dataset then contains the combination
          of all non-null values.
        - 'override': skip comparing and pick variable from first dataset
    positions : None or list of integer arrays, optional
        List of integer arrays which specifies the integer positions to which
        to assign each dataset along the concatenated dimension. If not
        supplied, objects are concatenated in the provided order.
    fill_value : scalar, optional
        Value to use for newly missing values
    join : {'outer', 'inner', 'left', 'right', 'exact'}, optional
        String indicating how to combine differing indexes
        (excluding dim) in objects

        - 'outer': use the union of object indexes
        - 'inner': use the intersection of object indexes
        - 'left': use indexes from the first object with each dimension
        - 'right': use indexes from the last object with each dimension
        - 'exact': instead of aligning, raise `ValueError` when indexes to be
          aligned are not equal
        - 'override': if indexes are of same size, rewrite indexes to be
          those of the first object with that dimension. Indexes for the same
          dimension must have the same size in all objects.

    Returns
    -------
    concatenated : type of objs

    Notes
    -----
    Each concatenated Variable preserves corresponding ``attrs`` from the first element of ``objs``.
