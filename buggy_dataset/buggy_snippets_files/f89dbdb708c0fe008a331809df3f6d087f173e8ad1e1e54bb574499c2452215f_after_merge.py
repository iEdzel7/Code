        Warning:
            Calling this method overwrites existing values, if any.

        Args:
            headers (dict or list): A dictionary of header names and values
                to set, or a ``list`` of (*name*, *value*) tuples. Both *name*
                and *value* must be of type ``str`` or ``StringType`` and
                contain only ISO-8859-1 characters. Under Python 2.x, the
                ``unicode`` type is also accepted, although such strings are
                also limited to ISO-8859-1.

                Note:
                    Falcon can process a list of tuples slightly faster
                    than a dict.

        Raises:
            ValueError: `headers` was not a ``dict`` or ``list`` of ``tuple``.
