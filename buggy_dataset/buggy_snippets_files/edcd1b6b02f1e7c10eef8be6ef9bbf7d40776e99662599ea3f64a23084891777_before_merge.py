        Arguments are the same as that of
        :class:`_types.Enum`, but also including
        the following parameters.

        :param create_type: Defaults to True.
         Indicates that ``CREATE TYPE`` should be
         emitted, after optionally checking for the
         presence of the type, when the parent
         table is being created; and additionally
         that ``DROP TYPE`` is called when the table
         is dropped.    When ``False``, no check
         will be performed and no ``CREATE TYPE``
         or ``DROP TYPE`` is emitted, unless
         :meth:`~.postgresql.ENUM.create`
         or :meth:`~.postgresql.ENUM.drop`
         are called directly.
         Setting to ``False`` is helpful
         when invoking a creation scheme to a SQL file
         without access to the actual database -
         the :meth:`~.postgresql.ENUM.create` and
         :meth:`~.postgresql.ENUM.drop` methods can
         be used to emit SQL to a target bind.
