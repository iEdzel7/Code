        :param confidence: Confidence of adversarial examples: a higher value produces examples that are farther away,
                from the original input, but classified with higher confidence as the target class.

        :param targeted: Should the attack target one specific class.
        :type targeted: `bool`

                but are slower to converge.

                confidence. If `binary_search_steps` is large, the initial constant is not important, as discussed in
                Carlini and Wagner (2016).
