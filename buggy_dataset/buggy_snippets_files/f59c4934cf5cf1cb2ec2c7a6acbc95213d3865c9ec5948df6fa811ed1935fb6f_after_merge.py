    The trajectory contains only data from one episode and from one agent.

    contain a truncated (at-the-end) episode, in case the
    `config.rollout_fragment_length` was reached by the sampler.
    - If `config.batch_mode=complete_episodes`, sample_batch will contain
    exactly one episode (no matter how long).
    New columns can be added to sample_batch and existing ones may be altered.

    Args:
        policy (Policy): The Policy used to generate the trajectory
            (`sample_batch`)
        sample_batch (SampleBatch): The SampleBatch to postprocess.
        other_agent_batches (Optional[Dict[PolicyID, SampleBatch]]): Optional
            dict of AgentIDs mapping to other agents' trajectory data (from the
            same episode). NOTE: The other agents use the same policy.
        episode (Optional[MultiAgentEpisode]): Optional multi-agent episode
            object in which the agents operated.
