        This takes in a new request packet, adds it to the current
        packet stream, and performs framing on it. That is, checks
        for complete messages, and once found, will process all that
        exist.  This handles the case when we read N + 1 or 1 / N
        messages at a time instead of 1.

        The processed and decoded messages are pushed to the callback
        function to process and send.
