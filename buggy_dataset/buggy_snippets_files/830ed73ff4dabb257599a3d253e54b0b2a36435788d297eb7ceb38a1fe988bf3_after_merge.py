        """Concatenate variables along a new or existing dimension.

        Parameters
        ----------
        variables : iterable of Array
            Arrays to stack together. Each variable is expected to have
            matching dimensions and shape except for along the stacked
            dimension.
        dim : str or DataArray, optional
            Name of the dimension to stack along. This can either be a new
            dimension name, in which case it is added along axis=0, or an
            existing dimension name, in which case the location of the
            dimension is unchanged. Where to insert the new dimension is
            determined by the first variable.
        positions : None or list of integer arrays, optional
            List of integer arrays which specifies the integer positions to
            which to assign each dataset along the concatenated dimension.
            If not supplied, objects are concatenated in the provided order.
        shortcut : bool, optional
            This option is used internally to speed-up groupby operations.
            If `shortcut` is True, some checks of internal consistency between
            arrays to concatenate are skipped.

        Returns
        -------
        stacked : Variable
            Concatenated Variable formed by stacking all the supplied variables
            along the given dimension.
