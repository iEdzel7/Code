    Download a script from a remote source and execute it only if a watch
    statement calls it.

    source
        The source script being downloaded to the minion, this source script is
        hosted on the salt master server.  If the file is located on the master
        in the directory named spam, and is called eggs, the source string is
        salt://spam/eggs

    template
        If this setting is applied then the named templating engine will be
        used to render the downloaded file, currently jinja, mako, and wempy
        are supported

    name
        The command to execute, remember that the command will execute with the
        path and permissions of the salt-minion.

    cwd
        The current working directory to execute the command in, defaults to
        /root

    runas
        The user name to run the command as

    shell
        The shell to use for execution, defaults to the shell grain

    env
        A list of environment variables to be set prior to execution.
        Example:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            salt://scripts/foo.sh:
              cmd.wait_script:
                - env:
                  - BATCH: 'yes'

        .. warning::

            The above illustrates a common PyYAML pitfall, that **yes**,
            **no**, **on**, **off**, **true**, and **false** are all loaded as
            boolean ``True`` and ``False`` values, and must be enclosed in
            quotes to be used as strings. More info on this (and other) PyYAML
            idiosyncrasies can be found :ref:`here <yaml-idiosyncrasies>`.

        Variables as values are not evaluated. So $PATH in the following
        example is a literal '$PATH':

        .. code-block:: yaml

            salt://scripts/bar.sh:
              cmd.wait_script:
                - env: "PATH=/some/path:$PATH"

        One can still use the existing $PATH by using a bit of Jinja:

        .. code-block:: jinja

            {% set current_path = salt['environ.get']('PATH', '/bin:/usr/bin') %}

            mycommand:
              cmd.run:
                - name: ls -l /
                - env:
                  - PATH: {{ [current_path, '/my/special/bin']|join(':') }}

    umask
         The umask (in octal) to use when running the command.

    stateful
        The command being executed is expected to return data about executing
        a state. For more information, see the :ref:`stateful-argument` section.

    use_vt
        Use VT utils (saltstack) to stream the command output more
        interactively to the console and the logs.
        This is experimental.

    output_loglevel : debug
        Control the loglevel at which the output from the command is logged to
        the minion log.

        .. note::
            The command being run will still be logged at the ``debug``
            loglevel regardless, unless ``quiet`` is used for this value.

    hide_output : False
        Suppress stdout and stderr in the state's results.

        .. note::
            This is separate from ``output_loglevel``, which only handles how
            Salt logs to the minion log.

        .. versionadded:: 2018.3.0

    success_retcodes: This parameter will be allow a list of
        non-zero return codes that should be considered a success.  If the
        return code returned from the run matches any in the provided list,
        the return code will be overridden with zero.
