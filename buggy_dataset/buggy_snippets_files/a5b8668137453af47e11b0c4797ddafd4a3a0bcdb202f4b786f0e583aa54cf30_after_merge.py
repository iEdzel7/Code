    """Assign weights to each node based on how "deep" they are.

    This implementation may change at any point in the future without prior
    notice.

    We take the length for the longest path to any node from root, ignoring any
    paths that contain a single node twice (i.e. cycles). This is done through
    a depth-first search through the graph, while keeping track of the path to
    the node.

    Cycles in the graph result would result in node being revisited while also
    being it's own path. In this case, take no action. This helps ensure we
    don't get stuck in a cycle.

    When assigning weight, the longer path (i.e. larger length) is preferred.
