        """Generate indices to split data into training and test set.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)
            Training data, where n_samples is the number of samples
            and n_features is the number of features.

            Note that providing ``y`` is sufficient to generate the splits and
            hence ``np.zeros(n_samples)`` may be used as a placeholder for
            ``X`` instead of actual training data.

        y : array-like, shape (n_samples,)
            The target variable for supervised learning problems.
            Stratification is done based on the y labels.

        groups : object
            Always ignored, exists for compatibility.

        Returns
        -------
        train : ndarray
            The training set indices for that split.

        test : ndarray
            The testing set indices for that split.
