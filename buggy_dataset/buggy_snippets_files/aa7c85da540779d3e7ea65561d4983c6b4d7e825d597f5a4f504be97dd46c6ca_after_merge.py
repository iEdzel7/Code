    Examples:

        _translate_train_sizes([5, 10], 10) -> [5, 10]

    Parameters
    ----------
    train_sizes : array-like, shape (n_ticks,), dtype float or int
        Numbers of training examples that will be used to generate the
        learning curve. If the dtype is float, it is regarded as a
        fraction of 'n_max_training_samples', i.e. it has to be within (0, 1].

    n_max_training_samples : int
        Maximum number of training samples (upper bound of 'train_sizes').

    Returns
    -------
    train_sizes_abs : array, shape (n_unique_ticks,), dtype int
        Numbers of training examples that will be used to generate the
        learning curve. Note that the number of ticks might be less
        than n_ticks because duplicate entries will be removed.
