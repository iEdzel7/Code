    def query(self, x, k=1, eps=0, p=2, distance_upper_bound=np.inf):
        """
        Query the kd-tree for nearest neighbors

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : array_like, last dimension self.m
            An array of points to query.
        k : integer
            The number of nearest neighbors to return.
        eps : nonnegative float
            Return approximate nearest neighbors; the kth returned value
            is guaranteed to be no further than (1+eps) times the
            distance to the real kth nearest neighbor.
        p : float, 1<=p<=infinity
            Which Minkowski p-norm to use.
            1 is the sum-of-absolute-values "Manhattan" distance
            2 is the usual Euclidean distance
            infinity is the maximum-coordinate-difference distance
        distance_upper_bound : nonnegative float
            Return only neighbors within this distance. This is used to prune
            tree searches, so if you are doing a series of nearest-neighbor
            queries, it may help to supply the distance to the nearest neighbor
            of the most recent point.

        Returns
        -------
        d : float or array of floats
            The distances to the nearest neighbors.
            If x has shape tuple+(self.m,), then d has shape tuple if
            k is one, or tuple+(k,) if k is larger than one. Missing
            neighbors (e.g. when k > n or distance_upper_bound is
            given) are indicated with infinite distances.  If k is None,
            then d is an object array of shape tuple, containing lists
            of distances. In either case the hits are sorted by distance
            (nearest first).
        i : integer or array of integers
            The locations of the neighbors in self.data. i is the same
            shape as d.
